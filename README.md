# Transaction Management App (MERN Stack)

This is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to manage and view transactions. Users can add, edit, and delete transactions. The application interacts with a backend API to fetch, update, and delete transaction data.

## Features

- View a list of transactions in a table.
- Add new transactions.
- Edit existing transactions.
- Delete transactions.
- Responsive design with a clean user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store transactions.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js to handle API requests.
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend API.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (Download from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/)).
- **npm** (npm comes with Node.js, but you can also install it separately).
- **MongoDB** (You can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for a cloud database or install MongoDB locally).

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder.

   ```bash
   cd backend
Install backend dependencies.

bash
Copier le code
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend folder and add the following MongoDB URI (replace with your own MongoDB URI if you're using MongoDB Atlas):

bash
Copier le code
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/transactiondb
PORT=3001
Start the backend server.

bash
Copier le code
npm start
The backend API will now be running at http://localhost:3001.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend folder.

bash
Copier le code
cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies.

bash
Copier le code
npm install
Start the frontend React development server.

bash
Copier le code
npm start
The frontend will be running at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
The list of transactions will be displayed in a table.
You can:
Add a transaction: Fill out the form and click the "Add" button.
Edit a transaction: Click "Edit" on a transaction to modify it.
Delete a transaction: Click "Delete" to remove a transaction from the list.

This README is set up for a full-stack MERN application, including both the front-end and back-end configurations. It also assumes you're using MongoDB (either locally or with MongoDB Atlas). Make sure to replace placeholders like `your-username` and any specific configurations according to your actual setup.
